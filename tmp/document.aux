The reader can refer to Supplementary Figure 1A for a two ATC level granularity. The similarity descriptor ranges from 0 (not similar - white) to 1 (identical - black). Drugs are grouped according to their first ATC level (colours on the side). For instance, the compound reteplase (DB00015) has the ATC code B01AD07, which appears as “B” (dark orange) on the plot. The average similarity of drugs present in the same therapeutic category is significantly higher on average when separately compared to all other indications.}}{5}}
